Movie App is a dynamic and user-friendly platform for movie lovers. The app uses the TMDB movie API to provide an extensive database of movies, sorted by popularity, top rated, upcoming and now playing. Users have the ability to search for movies based on title, and view detailed information about each movie, including the overview, release date, rating, and genre.
